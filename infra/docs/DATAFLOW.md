# Data flow — where a request actually goes, file by file

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) describes the shape of the system. This one
follows a single request through the code, naming the file and line at each
step, and answers the questions the file layout does not.

## 1. Provisioning — how the cluster comes up

One command, `setup/lambda_cluster.sh`, wraps everything. It sources a guard and
runs two scripts in order.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as You
    participant C as lambda_cluster.sh
    participant G as _lambda_only.sh
    participant K as lambda_k3s_hami.sh
    participant A as lambda_apply_slices.sh
    participant API as Kubernetes

    U->>C: make up
    C->>G: source (guard)
    G->>G: refuse on macOS or without nvidia-smi
    C->>K: bash
    K->>K: install k3s, --default-runtime nvidia
    K->>API: helm install HAMi (kube-system)
    K->>API: helm install KEDA (keda ns)
    C->>A: bash
    A->>A: read nvidia-smi memory.total
    alt GPU > 50000 MiB
        A->>API: apply manifest, gpumem rewritten 22528 / 27648
    else
        A->>API: apply manifest as-is, two x 16384
    end
    A->>API: apply orch-serve, keda-prefill, keda-decode, open-webui
    A->>API: wait for workloads
```

| File | Creates |
|---|---|
| `setup/_lambda_only.sh` | Nothing — refuses to run off the GPU box |
| `setup/lambda_k3s_hami.sh` | k3s, HAMi scheduler, KEDA operator |
| `setup/lambda_apply_slices.sh` | vllm-prefill, vllm-decode, mooncake, orch-serve, ScaledObjects, Open WebUI |
| `setup/observability.sh` | Prometheus, Grafana, dashboards, DCGM — **separate step** |

Observability is deliberately not part of bring-up. That is why `kubectl -n
monitoring get pods` is empty until Step 22.

---

## 2. Gateway + admission

Four files run before any routing decision happens.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as serve.py Handler
    participant P as serve.prepare_chat
    participant GR as app/guardrails.py
    participant T as types.request_from_openai
    participant O as router/overflow.py
    participant A as gateway/admission.py

    C->>H: POST /v1/chat/completions
    H->>P: prepare_chat(payload)
    P->>GR: inspect(payload)
    GR->>GR: model allowlist, max_tokens clamp to 512,<br/>prompt length, vision needs image
    alt rejected
        GR-->>C: 400 model_not_allowed / prompt_too_long / ...
    end
    GR-->>P: cleaned payload
    H->>T: request_from_openai(payload)
    T->>T: prefix_hash = sha256(text[:256])[:16]
    T-->>H: Request
    H->>O: overflow.send(req)
    O->>A: gateway.handle(req)
    A->>A: tenant token window, 60 s
    alt over cap
        A-->>O: 429 tenant_tokens
        O-->>C: 429, never bursts
    end
    A->>A: place, enqueue, respond
```

| File | Line | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway/serve.py` | 110 | `do_POST` — reads body, branches on `kv_evict`, writes the response |
| `gateway/serve.py` | 18 | `prepare_chat` — runs guardrails, returns cleaned payload |
| `app/guardrails.py` | 23 | `inspect` — five 400s, **and mutates** `max_tokens` to 512 |
| `gateway/types.py` | — | `request_from_openai` — builds `Request`, derives `prefix_hash` |
| `router/overflow.py` | 40 | `send` — wraps everything; decides if the request leaves |
| `gateway/admission.py` | 19 | `handle` — per-tenant cap, then calls the router |

Two things that surprise people:

- **`prefix_hash` is computed for you.** `sha256` of the first 256 characters of
  the prompt. Identical openings therefore share a prefix automatically.
- **`Overflow` is outermost, not a sidecar.** `Gateway` sits *inside* it, so
  burst capacity is decided before and after admission, not alongside.

---

## 3. Router — what it actually decides

`router/` has seven files and they are not all in the request path.

| File | In the request path? | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `router.py` | **yes** | `place()` and `pick()` — the only decision-maker |
| `pools.py` | **yes** | `FakeWorker` / `VLLMWorker` — how a worker is talked to |
| `kvbus.py` | **yes** | Prefix bookkeeping and the prefill→decode hop |
| `overflow.py` | **yes** | Local-first vs burst |
| `mooncake.py` | no | A *server*, runs as its own pod. Not imported by the router |
| `planner.py` | no | Print-only replica math. Nothing consumes it |
| `trace.py` | side | Writes `traces/requests.jsonl` |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as admission.Gateway
    participant R as router.Router.place
    participant PK as Router.pick
    participant W as pools.VLLMWorker
    participant Q as gateway/queue.py

    A->>R: place(req)
    alt LAB_SPLIT=capability and not force_phase
        R->>PK: pick(pool by capability)
        PK-->>R: one worker, used for BOTH phases
    else phase split
        R->>PK: pick(prefill pool, PREFILL_SCORERS)
        R->>PK: pick(decode pool, DECODE_SCORERS)
    end
    PK->>W: snapshot()
    W->>W: GET /metrics on the vLLM pod
    W-->>PK: Snapshot(kv_free, waiting, running)
    PK->>PK: filter → deadline → sticky → score → p2c
    PK-->>R: worker or Shed
    R-->>A: Handoff(prefill, decode) or Shed
    A->>Q: enqueue(handoff, req)
```

`mooncake.py` being a server, not a client, is the one that trips people up —
it is `python -m router.mooncake` inside the `mooncake-store` pod. The client
side is `_store_put` in `kvbus.py`.

---

## 4. The queue — there isn't one

**There is no queue in orch-serve.** No `queue.Queue`, no `asyncio.Queue`, no
`deque`, no worker threads. Verified: zero matches across `gateway/`, `router/`
and `app/`.

`gateway/queue.py` is 17 lines and contains a single function. It does not
queue; it *sequences the two phases*:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as admission
    participant Q as queue.enqueue
    participant P as prefill worker
    participant B as KVBus
    participant D as decode worker

    A->>Q: enqueue(handoff, req)
    alt same worker both ends
        Q->>P: enqueue(req, phase="both")
        Q-->>A: (None, completion)
    else two workers
        Q->>P: enqueue(req, phase="prefill")
        Q->>B: transfer(p.id, d.id, req)
        Q->>D: enqueue(req, phase="decode")
        Q-->>A: (hop, completion)
    end
```

Every call is **synchronous and blocking**. So where does queuing happen?

| Layer | Queue | Observed as |
|---|---|---|
| orch-serve | none — one OS thread per request, `ThreadingHTTPServer` (`serve.py:164`) | concurrency = thread count |
| `FakeWorker` | plain dicts: `_prefill_left`, `_decode_left` (`pools.py:67`) | `queue_depth` in the snapshot |
| **vLLM** | the real one — continuous batching scheduler | `vllm:num_requests_waiting` |

So `queue_depth` that the router scores on is **vLLM's waiting count**, scraped
over HTTP. The router never holds a request; it decides and hands off. That is
why the deadline filter estimates wait as `queue_depth × 0.2 s` rather than
measuring its own backlog — it has none.

---

## 5. Prefill/decode segregation

The split is a **routing convention, not an engine feature**. Both pods run an
ordinary, complete vLLM. Nothing tells vLLM "you are prefill-only".

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Router
    participant P as vllm-prefill
    participant B as KVBus
    participant M as mooncake-store
    participant D as vllm-decode

    Note over R: LAB_SPLIT=phase
    R->>P: enqueue(req, phase="prefill")
    Note over P: a normal chat completion
    R->>B: transfer(p0, d0, req)
    B->>M: POST /put {src, dst, tokens, prefix}
    R->>D: enqueue(req, phase="decode")
    Note over D: another normal chat completion
```

What "segregation" means concretely:

| Layer | What separates them |
|---|---|
| Deployment | Two Deployments, labels `phase: prefill` / `phase: decode` |
| Router | Two lists, `Router.prefill` and `Router.decode`, different scorers |
| Scoring | Prefill weights prefix-cache 2.0; decode weights active requests |
| Engine | **Nothing.** Same image, same args shape, different model |

Under `LAB_SPLIT=capability` — what the cluster actually runs — the two pools
hold *different models* (text vs vision), one pick per request, and **no KV
hop**. The phase split only happens with `LAB_SPLIT=phase` or the REPL's `hop`.

The `phase=` argument is passed to `Worker.enqueue` and `FakeWorker` uses it to
decide which counters to move. `VLLMWorker.enqueue` **ignores it entirely** —
look at `pools.py:190`, it posts the same payload regardless.

---

## 6. HAMi — what it buys you

HAMi is a scheduler plus a CUDA shim. It lets two pods hold one physical GPU
with enforced memory ceilings.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Deployment
    participant S as hami-scheduler
    participant N as Node
    participant C as container
    participant V as vLLM

    D->>S: pod wants gpumem 16384, gpucores 35
    S->>N: does a GPU have that much unallocated?
    alt no
        S-->>D: Pending, FailedScheduling
    end
    S->>N: bind pod to a device
    N->>C: start with HAMi CUDA shim
    V->>C: cudaMemGetInfo()
    C-->>V: 16384 MiB (the slice, NOT the 40/80 GiB card)
    V->>V: gpu_memory_utilization x 16384
```

The last two steps are the ones that matter. **vLLM sees the slice, not the
card**, so `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.50` means half of 16384 MiB, not half the
GPU. That is why a VL model whose weights take 7.155 GiB fails inside an 8 GiB
budget while the text model at ~6.2 GiB survives.

What HAMi gives you: two models on one card, a hard memory ceiling per pod, and
a distinct failure mode — `slice_oom`, where the pod is healthy and scheduled
but cannot grow. Without it you would need one GPU per model, and one runaway
request could starve its neighbour.

---

## 7. KEDA — what it buys you

KEDA turns a Prometheus number into a replica count. That is all it does; it
does not route, admit, or place.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as orch-serve
    participant P as Prometheus
    participant K as KEDA
    participant H as HPA
    participant D as Deployment

    loop scrape interval
        P->>O: GET /metrics
        O-->>P: orch_tokens_in_flight{phase="prefill"}
    end
    loop poll interval
        K->>P: query
        P-->>K: value
        K->>H: set desired replicas
        H->>D: scale, clamped min..max
    end
```

| ScaledObject | Min | Max | Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prefill-scaler` | 1 | 2 | `orch_tokens_in_flight{phase="prefill"}` |
| `decode-scaler` | 1 | 2 | `vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc or orch_tokens_in_flight{phase="decode"}` |

Two things worth knowing. These are **two independent loops on different
intervals**, so a burst appears in Grafana well before replicas move. And
`READY=False` on both ScaledObjects before Step 22 is correct — the trigger is
Prometheus, which does not exist yet.

`router/planner.py` computes the same idea in-process and publishes
`orch_planner_desired_replicas`, but **no ScaledObject reads it**. It exists so
you can reason about the control law on a laptop.

---

## 8. Engine internals

Each pod runs stock `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.11.0` with four meaningful flags:

| Flag | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--enable-prefix-caching` | on | vLLM's *own* prefix cache — unrelated to `KVBus` |
| `--scheduling-policy` | `priority` | Its scheduler honours request priority |
| `--max-model-len` | 2048 | Caps context, which caps KV per request |
| `--gpu-memory-utilization` | 0.50 | Fraction **of the HAMi slice** |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as VLLMWorker
    participant API as vLLM API server
    participant SCH as vLLM scheduler
    participant GPU as GPU

    W->>API: POST /v1/chat/completions
    API->>SCH: add to waiting queue
    loop continuous batching
        SCH->>SCH: admit what fits in KV
        SCH->>GPU: prefill new, decode running
    end
    SCH-->>API: completion
    API-->>W: JSON
    Note over W: separately, every placement
    W->>API: GET /metrics
    API-->>W: num_requests_waiting / running / gpu_cache_usage_perc
```

**There are two prefix caches and they do not talk to each other.** vLLM's is
real, inside the engine, block-level. `KVBus` is the router's bookkeeping. The
router cannot see vLLM's, and evicting from `KVBus` does not evict from vLLM.

Startup order, which is why `READY 1/1` misleads: download weights → load
safetensors → `torch.compile` → capture CUDA graphs → *then* bind the port.
Minutes, with almost no log output.

---

## 9. Parallelism — there isn't any

Nothing in this lab sets up tensor, pipeline, or data parallelism. No
`--tensor-parallel-size`, `--pipeline-parallel-size` or data-parallel flag
appears anywhere in `k8s-config/` or `setup/`. The engine log confirms it:

```
rank 0 in world size 1 is assigned as DP rank 0, PP rank 0, TP rank 0, EP rank 0
```

Every engine is a **single process on a single GPU slice**. What looks like
parallelism here is:

| Looks like | Actually is |
|---|---|
| Two GPU "devices" | HAMi slicing one card |
| Two pools | Two independent engines, different models |
| Scaling to 2 replicas | KEDA adding a second independent pod |
| Prefill/decode split | Two sequential HTTP calls from the router |

Model parallelism is module 5's topic. Module 9 is about **placement and
admission across replicas**, not splitting one model across GPUs — which is why
a 3B model is used throughout and never needs more than one slice.
